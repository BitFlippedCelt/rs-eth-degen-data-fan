# ETH Bot Antics

## Description

This repo contains a bunch of bits and pieces that I have built in a fun effort to develop EVM bot(s) to interact with EVM based networks. I can't promise that any of this code is good, but I can promise that it is fun. Well is for me at least. ü§£

## Disclaimer ‚öñÔ∏è

This is a repo for a Rust based EVM bot framework of sorts I guess. The contents of this repo are not intended to be used for anything other than educational purposes. The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how to interact with the EVM using Rust. No guarantees are made about the quality of the code in this repo. I am not a Rust developer, and I am not an EVM developer. I am just a guy who likes to tinker with things. üò∏
