This is a random journey down the rabbit hole of blockchain data. Designing a system to read chain information then fan it out to other services for various purposes.

This code is not production ready. Nor is it feature complete. It is the remains of a long weekend(s) that I wanted to learn more about Rust and the various crates that are available. This is provided as-is and with no guarantees. Have fun!
